Project Infinity is an Authentic Indie JRPG Game. 

“Project Infinity” is an experiment JRPG and one my first try in RPG Development World, heavily influenced by our love of the classic JRPG games, while mixing my unique approaches to core mechanics, gameplay, and storytelling.

## 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐂𝐄𝐏𝐓...?
Project Infinity is set in a semi-fantasy universe where a living princess, Anna, has outlawed magic bringing war and genocide to those that oppose him. She doesn't know about her background because her parents hide the secret from her and everyone, for the reason to keep her safe from the Evil Commander. The King gives responsibility to a Samurai who is the Cheif General of the Army of his kingdom, He was known by the name, Ethan, to protect her child, Anna, as she was the next person to become Princess of the Kingdom. The King ordered Ethan, to keep Anna in the safest place, which was a mile away from the kingdom.
 They escape and hides in an abandoned, war-torn town. On a supply run, and The Evil Commander was also in search of them.
Every Character that joins there side in the battle has a story to tell, and a reason to fight.
